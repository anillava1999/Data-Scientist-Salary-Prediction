## Project Overview
• Created a machine learning model that **estimates salary of data scientist based on the features like rating, company_founded, etc.**<br/>
• Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, tableau and sql

## How will this project help?
• This project **helps data scientist/analyst to negotiate their income for an existing or a new job**

## Resources Used
• Packages: **pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.**<br/>
• Dataset by **Ken Jee**: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning
• **Removed unwanted columns**: 'Unnamed: 0'<br/>
• **Plotted bargraphs and countplots** for numerical and categorical features respectively for EDA<br/>
• **Numerical Features** (Rating, Founded): **Replaced NaN or -1 values with mean or meadian based on their distribution**<br/>


• **Categorical Features: Replaced NaN or -1 values with 'Other'/'Unknown' category**<br/>
• **Removed unwanted alphabet/special characters from Salary feature**<br/>
• **Converted the Salary column into one scale** i.e from (per hour, per annum, employer provided salary) to (per annum)

## Feature Engineering
• **Creating new features** from existing features e.g. **job_in_headquaters from (job_location, headquarters)**, etc.<br/>
• Trimming columns i.e. **Trimming features having more than 10 categories to reduce the dimensionality**<br/>
• **Handling ordinal and nominal categorical features**<br/>
• Feature Selection using **information gain (mutual_info_regression) and correlation matrix**<br/>
• Feature Scaling using **StandardScalar**

## Model Building and Evaluation
Metric: Negative Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE)<br/>
• Multiple Linear Regression: -27.523<br/>
• Lasso Regression: -27.993<br/>
• **Random Forest: -17.637**<br/>
• Gradient Boosting: -24.429<br/>
• Voting (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting): -19.136<br/>
_**Note: Evaluation scores are obtained using cross validation.**_

## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.
* Flight Price Prediction created as an AI module and integrated with Web app to predict the price of flight ticket.
* Developed these POC the Internship.
* Created API using Flask Framework and integrated with Heroku cloud platform.


## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.9 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bug / Feature Request

If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/Mandal-21/Flight-Price-Prediction/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result

## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Front-End
